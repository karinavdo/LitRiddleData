This is an R package being a part of the Riddle of Literary Quality project.

The package contains the data of a reader survey about fiction in Dutch, a description of the novels the readers rated, and the results of stylistic measurements of the novels. The package also contains functions to combine, analyze, and visualize these data.

See: [https://literaryquality.huygens.knaw.nl/](https://literaryquality.huygens.knaw.nl/) for further details.

## Installation

Install the package directly from the GitHub repository:

```
library(devtools)
install_github("karinavdo/LitRiddleData", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```


## Usage

There will be a vignette added to this package that will briefly guide the users through the functions of the package. So far, one is in the mercy of the generic `help()` function in R.
