\details{
The package litRiddle presents data generated in the project The Riddle of Literary Quality (2012--2019) in which a team of digital humanists aimed to find out if books that readers considered to be highly literary have a different set of values for stylistic features than books the same readers did not consider to be very literary.

The package contains five data sets:
  \enumerate{
    \item The reviews gathered from a hired representative panel of citizens of the Netherlands and in a large online survey called The National Reader Survey (2013). Type \cite{help(reviews)} for details.
    \item The motivations that reviewers give for a subset or all of their ratings are provided as plain text and as POS tagged data. Type \cite{help(motivations)} for details.
    \item Data about the reviewers: age, gender, zipcode, average 
    number of books read per year etc. Type \cite{help(respondents)} 
    for details.
    \item A list of the 401 books that the survey respondents evaluated with metadata such as author, title, publisher, gender of the author, and for translations the original language, etc., as well as a number
    of stylometric measurements such as the average sentence lengh etc.
    Type \cite{help(books)} for details.
    \item For each of the 401 books, the relative frequencies of 5000
    most frequent words are provided (due to copyright issues the books themselves cannot be made available). Type \cite{help(frequencies)} 
    for details.
  }
To learn more about the functions provided to analyze the above datasets, type the function \code{explain()} in your terminal.
